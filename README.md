# Python to Bash transcompiler
## I was inspired by Dr.Crawley of Lipscomb University to look more into compilers and interpreters.
___
This repo holds the code for a simple interpreter that will take python code and curn out bash code.
This transcriber will not handle multi-line strings nor comments, will only handle very simple strings, no functions, no classes
